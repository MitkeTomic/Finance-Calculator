The project is a Python program that demonstrates the use of conditional statements, user input, and mathematical operations.

The program begins by printing a menu that presents two options - investment or bond. It then takes user input to determine which option they want to choose. If the user chooses investment, the program prompts the user to input the deposit amount, interest rate, number of years, and type of interest (simple or compound). Based on this input, the program calculates the total return on investment using the appropriate formula and displays the result to the user.

If the user chooses bond, the program prompts the user to input the present value of the property, interest rate, and number of months over which they will repay the bond. The program then calculates the monthly repayment amount using the appropriate formula and displays the result to the user.

If the user chooses an option other than investment or bond, the program displays an error message.

The program uses conditional statements (if-elif-else) to determine which option the user has chosen and to execute the appropriate block of code. It also uses the math module to perform mathematical operations such as exponentiation.

Overall, the program is a simple example of how Python can be used to perform financial calculations based on user input.
